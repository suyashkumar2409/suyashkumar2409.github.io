Through the course of my studies and research, I will be reading research papers on a daily basis, from the fields of CV, NLP, RL and ML for the most part. I plan to regularly update this list with the paper name, link and type for fun. If a particular paper really moves me (and if I have sufficient time) I shall write my thoughts on it as a blog post as well. 

The following list begins from 28th August 2023 - 

**September 2023**

1. [Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661) - CV - 4th September 2023
2. [Segment Anything](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02643) - Computer Vision - 4th September 2023
3. [Language Models are Unsupervised Multi-task Learners](https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf) - NLP - 4th September 2023
4. [Language models are few shot learners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165) - NLP - 1st September 2023
