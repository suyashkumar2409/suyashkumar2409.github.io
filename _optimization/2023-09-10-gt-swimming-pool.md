Hi! I am [Suyash](/). I make [cool stuff](/optimization) and I do [cool things](/fun).

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/SuyashKumar-Square.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>


Georgia Tech's swimming pool - McAuley Aquatic Center posts pool availability on it's website. 

I wrote a [script](https://github.com/suyashkumar2409/gt-swimming-script) that "automagically" reads from the website and populates a calendar.

No longer bother to check swimming availability times on the [CRC website](https://www.crc.gatech.edu/aquatics/hours).
